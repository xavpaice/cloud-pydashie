Cloud-PyDashie
########

PyDashie is a port of `Dashing <https://github.com/Shopify/dashing>`_ by `Shopify <http://www.shopify.com/>`_ to Python 2.7

This is simply an implementation of pydashie tailored to showing information about an openstack cluster with nagios/icinga for monitoring. It is primarily for internal use by maintainers of openstack deloyments, as the current flask file servicing may be somewhat unsafe for public access.

It uses the standard python clients for collecting formation from openstack across multiple regions.

The nagios/icinga data is currently collected via ssh but in future might be moved to MKlivestatus as the current method is roundabout.

**NOTE**: The current layout is hardcoded for 1080p. This might be changed to be configurable by the conf.yaml later. If you need to change the sizing, you can do so by changing the widget dimensions and number of columns within this function:

Configuration
############

Configuration is handled via a yaml file as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    main:
        log_file: pydashie.log
    openstack:
        allocation:
            RegionOne:
                vcpus_allocation_ratio: 2.0
                ram_allocation_ratio: 1.0
                # remove this amount per node available metric:
                reserved_ram_per_node: 0
                reserved_vcpus_per_node: 0
                # remove this amount from total
                # to take into account possible nova evacuate:
                reserved_vcpus: 0
                # ram in bytes
                reserved_ram: 0
                # total IPs are here as getting this from Neutron is
                # far from straightforward
                total_floating_ips: 256
        auth:
            auth_url: 'http://localhost:5000/v2.0'
            username: 'admin'
            password: 'openstack'
            project_name: 'demo'
            insecure: False
    nagios:
        services:
            RegionOne:
                statfile: './RegionOne-status.dat'
                host: 'RegionOne-mon0'
                username: 'admin'

Because of differences between allocation per region, and the need for a region list, each region is given it's own allocation data. We use this to know which regions to build clients for and aggregate data over, but in future might try and query a for a full region list and for allocation data from openstack itself.

The nagios collection relies on a local ssh key for the given username, and access for that key on the given host.

Info on adding/removing/updating widgets will go here later.

Installation
############

**NOTE**: Development/deployment has been done in a Ubuntu environment, so the following might be different for you. Also, the following is a step by step guide for installing into a clean server.

Some of the python libraries have certain requirements, and the app itself needs a javascript service to deal with javascript files. As such you will need the following packages:

    sudo apt-get install python-dev nodejs

You will ideally want to run the app inside a virtualenv. If you don't have virtualenv installed you can get it via:

    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

And then create the environment by (this will create a directory for the environment, so be careful where you do this):

    virtualenv <name_of_environment>

To then activate it:

    source <name_of_environment>/bin/activate

Now that you are in your environment, you will need to install all the required python libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

At this point you can install the app itself.

For development purposes use:

    python setup.py develop

Which will build a python egg pointing to the local git files so that you can edit them and just restart the service when you change them.

If you aren't planning to develop or edit the files:

    python setup.py install

But if the files are changed, or you pull an update, you will need to rerun the install.

Running
############

Provided you have a conf with working credentials and correctly named regions, you can run the application by:

    pydashie -c conf.yaml

Goto localhost:5050 to view the application in action.

**NOTE**: Getting the app up and running quickly with just openstack credentials is relatively easy, and you can simply comment out the nagios samplers from:

     https://github.com/catalyst/openstack-pydashie/blob/master/pydashie/openstack_app.py

The port and interface can also be set via the commandline:

    pydashie -c conf.yaml -ip 0.0.0.0 -p 5050

Although they default to 0.0.0.0 and 5050 if not manually given.
